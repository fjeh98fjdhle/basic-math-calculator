# Problems
1. works only on very simple functions
2. functions have to be very strict(e.g. no spaces etc.)
3. still a lot of things it can not do. (e.g. log, root, variables as floats.) 

# Goal 
1. normal calculator capabilities
2. text-interface
3. under 1000 lines of code/highly efficient
4. youtube guide on the code
