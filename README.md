# basic-math-calculator
just testing some math calculations. Goal is to make a very simple to use math calulator with text interface. Not really that crazy just simple to use.


Right now:  
slope between two points
first draft for calculator. Works with only very specific functions. A lot of mistakes. Will be fixed as the code improves.

Goal: 
derivative of a given function.
mean slope of a given function for intervall a,b. 
basic calculations. 
text-interface. 
in englisch.
make the code very easy and highly efficient to run.
get it to even work(if you run the files individually they work, but not accross multiple files.)
Explenation of code(youtube, and as "#'s" in the code.
