# basic-math-calculator
just testing some math calculations. Goal is to make a very simple to use math calulator with text interface. Feel free to use it and report bugs to make it even better.

# capabilities
computes a single-variable function with basic mathematical operations "+","-","/","*". 


# Goal 
1. normal calculator capabilities
2. text-interface
3. under 1000 lines of code/highly efficient
4. youtube guide on the code

# Example capabilities


# Problems
1. works only on very simple functions
2. functions have to be very strict(e.g. no spaces etc.)
3. still a lot of things it can not do. (e.g. log, root, variables as floats.)
